# latticist

*latticist* is an R package, providing a graphical user interface for
 exploratory visualisation.

I am not maintaining *latticist* any more. I have moved it to github,
as requested by some users, in the hope that it may be adopted.

The original project page is still up at
https://latticist.googlecode.com/ and it has a list of screenshots
that is not reproduced here.
