Changes in Version 0.9-41

  o fixed bug in latticist(use.playwith = TRUE), which failed
    when a custom entry was typed into a variable field.

  o changed graphics device initialisation in the gWidgets
    version of latticist, so it works now with JavaGD.

  o generalised the method for color-covariates used with
    cloud and parallel, to handle multiple panels (subscripts).
    Also, splom and stripplot now handle color-covariates too.

  o style settings (and more) can be set with latticist.options.

  o better help for ?latticistCompose and ?latticist.options.

    either a playwith-based GUI or a gWidgets-based GUI.

  o Latticist now supports table objects.

  o use package 'vcd' to produce a mosaic plot when
    two or more categorical variables are plotted.

  o code simplified; function latticistParse() defunct.
