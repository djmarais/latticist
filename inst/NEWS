
Changes in Version 0.9-41

  o changed graphics device initialisation in the gWidgets
    version of latticist, so it works now with JavaGD.

    cloud and parallel, to handle multiple panels (subscripts).

Changes in Version 0.9-40

  o Latticist now supports table objects.

  o use package 'vcd' to produce a mosaic plot when
    two or more categorical variables are plotted.

  o code simplified; function latticistParse() defunct.
